FamFamIconsOnRails
==================

Insert easily icons into your web application. In your rails views:
<%= icon :information %>

If you want to add alt text:
<%= icon :information, "Information icon" %>

If you want to add more attributes for the img tag, append them in the last
parameter:
<%= icon :information, "Information icon", :border => 0 %>

You can see a preview of the icons in the preview_icons.png file at the root of 
this plugin directory (RAILS_ROOT/vendor/plugins/fam_fam_icons_on_rails/preview_icons.png)
or at http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/previews/index_abc.png

These icons are a work of Mark James:
